            <h5>Orders Damaged by Shipping</h5>
            <p>Great care is taken when packing your order, but on rare occasions, errors may take place. When you receive
                your order, you should always do the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>While the delivery driver is still there, and before you sign the bill of lading, open, unpack, and
                    carefully inspect your order to check for completeness of order and any damage.</li>
                <li>Notate any damages or shortages of your order in detail on the freight bill. If the driver refuses to
                    stay while you check your order, write this on the freight bill near your signature.</li>
                <li>Any problems with your shipment must be reported to Thalimart.com at <a
                        href="tel:1-563-284-2254">1-563-284-2254</a> no later than one day after the receipt of your
                    shipment.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Thalimart.com is not responsible for any damaged or missing merchandise if the shipment is signed for as
                being complete and unharmed. If the driver was not there while the shipment was opened by you, then you must
                inform within one day to Thalimart.com at <a href="tel:1-563-284-2254">1-563-284-2254</a> about the damage
                else Thalimart.com will not be responsible for the damage.</p>
