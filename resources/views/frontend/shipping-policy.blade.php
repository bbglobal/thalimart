            <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
            <h5>Destinations</h5>
            <p>We will ship to anywhere in the contiguous United States. We are unable to ship to PO or APO/FPO boxes. If
                our shipping carrier deems your address inaccessible for delivery, we will make final delivery at the
                closest shipping terminal. If you are concerned about delivery to your address, please contact us before
                placing your order.</p>

            <h5>Methods & Charges</h5>
            <p>Thalimart.com Store ships the majority of its products via Fedex Ground. Surcharges are listed in the item
                description and will be noted when you view your shopping cart. The Thalimart.com Store reserves the right
                to select the best possible method for shipment.</p>

            <h5>Split Shipments</h5>
            <p>We will make every attempt to ship your order within one shipment. If multiple shipments of your order are
                required, you will only be charged for the products being shipped at that time. The shipping cost given
                during checkout will be split between the multiple shipments.</p>

            <h5>Delivery Time</h5>
            <p>All delivery times are estimates. Most products ship out of our New York warehouses, however some items will
                be shipped directly from the manufacturer. Common carrier deliveries range from 7 to 10 days for delivery,
                depending on your proximity to the shipping origin. Fedex ground shipping can take anywhere from one to six
                days. For quotes on expedite shipping, please contact customer service at <a
                    href="tel:15632842254">1-563-284-2254</a>.</p>

            <h5>Orders Damaged by Shipping</h5>
            <p>Great care is taken when packing your order, but on rare occasions, errors may take place. When you receive
                your order, you should always do the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>While the delivery driver is still there, and before you sign the bill of lading, open, unpack, and
                    carefully inspect your order to check for completeness of order and any damage.</li>
                <li>Notate any damages or shortages of your order in detail on the freight bill. If the driver refuses to
                    stay while you check your order, write this on the freight bill near your signature.</li>
                <li>Any problems with your shipment must be reported to the Thalimart.com at <a
                        href="tel:15632842254">1-563-284-2254</a> no later than one day after the receipt of your shipment.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Thalimart.com is not responsible for any damaged or missing merchandise if the shipment is signed for as
                being complete and unharmed. If the driver was not there while the shipment was opened by you, then you must
                inform within one day to Thalimart.com at <a href="tel:15632842254">1-563-284-2254</a> about the damage, else
                Thalimart.com will not be responsible for the damage.</p>
